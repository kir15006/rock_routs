# Overview


This is a simple web application that allows user to create, view and update rock climbing routs with different information. It's intended use is to allow a climber to work on many routs and keep track of all the information associated with that such as name and grade of the rout, as well as number of attempts and date completeted. 

 To start a test server on your computer, navigate to the project and run the command: python manage.py runserver
 This will start a test server and display the url to the page. By default it is http://127.0.0.1:8000/

I wrote this web application to help me learn the Djanog framwork and gain practice on a real project. I also love rock climbing and having a place to track my routs will be useful.

# Web Pages

The home page is a list of routs already created. They are displayed in two columns, Completed, and In Progrsss.

In the navigation is a button to create new rout. This leads to a form that allows the user to create a new rout. 

If you click on one of the routs in the list it will bring you to a second page with that routs details. You will also have an option to edit the rout.
